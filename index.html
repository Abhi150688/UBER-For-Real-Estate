      <p>UBER FOR REAL ESTATE (ANDROID)</p>

<p>We are making a marketplace like UBER which connects users &amp; property brokers in Real Time. I have created an Android app which mimics the UBER interface to a large extent. 
It starts with a map which is used to pick up the user's location. 
The user is then prompted to enter 3 parameters of his choice (Number of Bedroom, Budget, Type of Transaction - Rent or purchase). 
On clicking the Hail button, all realtors in a 3-4 km radius are intimated. 
The realtor who accepts the users request gets connected to him instantly and can schedule the property visit from there on. </p>

<p>Additional features include
a) Tracking history of all property visits performed
b) Ability to instantly give an offer (bid) to a property if the user likes it. </p>

<p>Other features that we are working on and which will be added in due course of time is: 
a) Ability to start a objective 3 way chat (between owner - broker - buyer) on the app to negotiate on the property using bids &amp; counter bids.
b) Using the data points from the bids &amp; counter bids performed on the app, we can generate real time indices that give information about ongoing prices in a particular location.  </p>

<p>I am still working on this project and we are in process of building the Server side logic. But I have open sourced the Android front end app (built in native code).
