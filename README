UBER FOR REAL ESTATE (ANDROID)

We are making a marketplace like UBER which connects users & property brokers in Real Time. I have created an Android app which mimics the UBER interface to a large extent. It starts with a map which is used to pick up the user's location. The user is then prompted to enter 3 parameters of his choice (Number of Bedroom, Budget, Type of Transaction - Rent or purchase). On clicking the Hail button, all realtors in a 3-4 km radius are intimated. The realtor who accepts the users request gets connected to him instantly and can schedule the property visit from there on.

Current features include

a) Tracking history of all property visits performed through the app. 

b) Ability to instantly start a dealing room with the broker by giving an offer (bid) to a property that you may like.

Other features that we are working on and which will be added in due course of time is:

a) Ability to start a objective 3 way chat (between owner - broker - buyer) on the app to negotiate on the property using bids & counter bids.

b) Using the data points from the bids & counter bids performed on the app, we can generate real time indices that give information about ongoing prices in a particular location.

We am still working on this project and we are in process of building the Server side logic. But I have open sourced the Android front end app (built in native code). People who are interested in this project can reach out to me on abhi150688@gmail.com

The same app works for the broker as well as the user. At the time of downloading the app there is an activity - ChooseRoleActivity where the user is asked to enter his intent. He can either choose - User or Property Broker. 

The main Activity for the User is 'MainActivity' while the MainActivity for the Broker is 'MainBrokerAcitivty'.
