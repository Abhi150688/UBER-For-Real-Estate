{"name":"Uber-for-real-estate","tagline":"Connect to a Real Estate Broker in Real Time!","body":"UBER FOR REAL ESTATE (ANDROID)\r\n\r\nWe are making a marketplace like UBER which connects users & property brokers in Real Time. I have created an Android app which mimics the UBER interface to a large extent. \r\nIt starts with a map which is used to pick up the user's location. \r\nThe user is then prompted to enter 3 parameters of his choice (Number of Bedroom, Budget, Type of Transaction - Rent or purchase). \r\nOn clicking the Hail button, all realtors in a 3-4 km radius are intimated. \r\nThe realtor who accepts the users request gets connected to him instantly and can schedule the property visit from there on. \r\n\r\n\r\nAdditional features include\r\na) Tracking history of all property visits performed\r\nb) Ability to instantly give an offer (bid) to a property if the user likes it. \r\n\r\nOther features that we are working on and which will be added in due course of time is: \r\na) Ability to start a objective 3 way chat (between owner - broker - buyer) on the app to negotiate on the property using bids & counter bids.\r\nb) Using the data points from the bids & counter bids performed on the app, we can generate real time indices that give information about ongoing prices in a particular location.  \r\n\r\n\r\nI am still working on this project and we are in process of building the Server side logic. But I have open sourced the Android front end app (built in native code).
