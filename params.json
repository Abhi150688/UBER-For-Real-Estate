{"name":"Uber-for-real-estate","tagline":"Connect to a Real Estate Broker in Real Time!","body":"We are making a marketplace like UBER which connects users & property brokers in Real Time. I have created an Android app which mimics the UBER interface to a large extent. \r\nIt starts with a map which is used to pick up the user's location. \r\nThe user is then prompted to enter 3 parameters of his choice (Number of Bedroom, Budget, Type of Transaction - Rent or purchase). \r\nOn clicking the Hail button, all realtors in a 3-4 km radius are intimated. \r\nThe realtor who accepts the users request gets connected to him instantly and can schedule the property visit from there on. \r\n\r\nI am still working on this project and we are in process of building the Server side logic. But I have open sourced the Android front end app (built in native code). People who are interested in this project can reach out to me on abhi150688@gmail.com","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
